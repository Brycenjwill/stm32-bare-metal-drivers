# STM32F4 Embedded Driver Practice

The goal is to learn bare-metal programming on the STM32F407 microcontroller by writing peripheral drivers (like GPIO, SPI, I2C, etc.) from scratch using register-level access.

This project is strictly for **learning purposes**.

## Setup

- Target: STM32F407 Discovery Board
- IDE: STM32CubeIDE / Eclipse with GNU ARM toolchain
- Language: C
